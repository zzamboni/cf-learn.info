The electronic versions of the book contain full syntax highlighting and other useful features. I'm biased of course, but I think it is both functional and beautiful. Here's a sample from Chapter 4:<p></p>
<blockquote class="webkit-indent-blockquote" style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed">
<a href="/images/2012/03/16/syntax-highlighting-in-learning-cfengine-3/39091981-final_web.pdf%20(page%20126%20of%20182)-1.jpg"><img alt="Final_web" height="527" src="/images/2012/03/16/syntax-highlighting-in-learning-cfengine-3/39091981-final_web.pdf%20(page%20126%20of%20182)-1.jpg" width="500"></a>
</div>
</div></blockquote>

<div>The syntax highlighting in my opinion greatly helps in reading the code. Additionally, each one of those numbered callouts in the code are in-document links that take you to the paragraph where that part of the code is described. Conversely, the callouts in the text take you back to the corresponding line in the code. And finally, most CFEngine keywords and concepts are links to the corresponding description in the CFEngine Reference Manual. In the PDF, clicking on that blue "files:" in the last paragraph will take you to <a href="http://cf-learn.info/ref/files">http://cf-learn.info/ref/files</a>
</div>

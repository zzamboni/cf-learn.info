Recently, the
[CFEngine documentation site](https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/index.html)
was completely overhauled, resulting in an easier-to-navigate,
easier-to-search experience (also easier to extend, since it's all
hosted on GitHub now).

I have just updated the
[CFEngine documentation index](http://blog.cf-learn.info/searching-cfengine-documentation/)
hosted on this site to point to the new documentation. The interface
is the same: you go to `http://cf-learn.info/ref/keyword`, replacing
`keyword` with your search term. This will automatically redirect you
to the appropriate section in the CFEngine documentation. If the term
matches more than one section, you will be given a list of potential
matches, and also a link to do a search for that term directly in the
documentation site.

Some examples:

- <http://cf-learn.info/ref/ifvarclass>
- <http://cf-learn.info/ref/classes>
- <http://cf-learn.info/ref/cf-sketch>

As part of the update, the index has been expanded to include
everything in the documentation site (before it only indexed the main
users' guide), so you can use it to find things not only in all the
[reference documents](https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/reference.html),
but also in the [manuals](https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/manuals.html)
and even in the
[examples](https://cfengine.com/docs/3.5/examples.html).

As I've said before, I think the real power of this index is in its
use as a browser keyword search. The method for doing this varies from
browser to browser. With Safari on OS X I use the
[KeySearch extension](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/keysearch/), so I
can just type "cf ifvarclass" on the Safari address bar, and go
directly to the documentation about `ifvarclass`.

Happy searching! And of course, please
[let me know](http://cf-learn.info/contact.html) if you find anything
missing or broken.

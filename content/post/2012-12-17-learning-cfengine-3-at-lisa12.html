<div>Last week I attended the Usenix <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12/">LISA'12</a> conference in San Diego, and the awesome people at O'Reilly organized a book signing while we were there. I'd like to share a couple of photos from the event. I had a great time!</div>
<p></p>
<div>The second release of the book has been out for a few weeks now. If you purchased the e-book from O'Reilly, make sure to check your "My books" page at <a href="http://oreilly.com">oreilly.com</a> to get the updated version!<p></p>

*** About CFEngine
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: about-cfengine
   :END:

[[https://cfengine.com/][CFEngine]] is a mature and widely used tool for configuration management. It was first released in 1993, and it has evolved over the years to address real needs in real systems, and to match technological developments such as virtualization and cloud computing. CFEngine is fine-tuned to the features and design that make it possible to automate very large numbers of systems in a scalable and manageable way. CFEngine has been designed to be very resource-efficient, and it can run on everything from embedded devices and smartphones to supercomputers.

CFEngine 3 was released in 2008. With the new version came a complete overhaul of its syntax and mode of operation, and many new features such as Knowledge Management and support for virtual environments. CFEngine 3 is *declarative* and *convergent*: you specify the state in which you wish the system to be, and CFEngine will automatically and iteratively decide the actions to take to reach the desired state, or as close to it as possible. Underlying this ability is a powerful theoretical model known as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_theory][Promise Theory]], which was initially developed for CFEngine 3, but which has also found other applications in Computer Science and in other fields such as Economics and Organization.

My name is Diego Zamboni, and I am the author of [[https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine][Learning CFEngine]]. I am a computer scientist, consultant, programmer, sysadmin and overall geek now turned manager, project lead and [[https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/e6bf0ca2-f1c4-4af6-bf63-09f4b8cdbd02/public_url][SAFe Product Owner]]. I am passionate about computer security, monitoring, virtualization, configuration management and system automation. Currently I work at [[https://swisscom.com/][Swisscom]] in the Cloud Products team, where I lead a team working on Health Management, Logging and Monitoring capabilities for Swisscom's cloud platforms.

During college I founded the [[https://web.archive.org/web/19981202131242/https://www.asc.unam.mx/][first computer security team at UNAM]] (Mexico's national university), which has grown to become [[https://www.seguridad.unam.mx/][a much larger organization]], before moving to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D. at [[https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/][Purdue University]] under the direction of [[https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/][Gene Spafford]]. Upon finishing my studies I moved to Switzerland, where I worked as a researcher in computer security at the [[https://www.zurich.ibm.com/][IBM Zurich Research Lab]]. After eight years there I moved back to Mexico, where I worked for [[https://www.hpe.com/][HP Enterprise Services]] as a security consultant. Afterwards I worked at [[https://cfengine.com/][CFEngine AS]], where I took the role of educator, advocate and language product owner. I am now back in Switzerland, where I live with my awesome wife and our two beautiful daughters.

These are all the source files included in the book, organized by chapter. Note that in the text, many examples show only fragments of a larger file (for example, when things are explained step by step). In these cases, only the complete file is linked here, and only once per chapter.

Note that the [[https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles/tree/master/lib][CFEngine Standard Library]] is not included here, despite several fragments of it being described in the book. The standard library is included with all recent releases of CFEngine, and you can also obtain it from its [[https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles][github repository]], along with the rest of the CFEngine masterfiles framework. Also not listed are any files from the CFEngine source code distribution that are described in the book.

Here are some of the nice things people have said about "Learning CFEngine 3" (since the O'Reilly Product Page for the book has disappeared, some of the links are to its last Wayback Machine archive snapshot). In most cases I have only included select quotes, you should follow the links to see the full review or comment.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The book is excellent. It explains CFEngine 3 in a manner which is easy to understand. The examples are practical and can be adapted for production use at our site. After reading the book, the online documentation finally made sense.

  I know I will use the book as long as I manage CFEngine 3. It complements the online reference manuals perfectly. I also highly recommend the PDF version for quick browsing.

  A brilliant book! (best book since friedl's mastering reg ex ;-)

  Diego Zamboni delivers here on just 160 Pages, short and sharp, an intense introduction to CFEngine and the underlying "promise theory".

  I bought this book, and I saw the light! I've now read the book and I'm writing clean CFEngine recipes with the feeling of doing a good job, which won't block me in the future.

  This /is/ the book about CFEngine 3. Start with this one if you want to commit to the real CFEngine philosophy, the productive and clean one.

  ... something happened, and things changed like when the night turns into a new day.

  When the early release of "Learning cfengine 3" was announced, I think I was one of the first people who bought it. I started reading it, and it was amazing: *all the things that were confusingly buzzing in my head started to line themselves orderly*. In a very little time, I was able to do much more than I had been able to do in months. And I finally could appreciate the good qualities of cfengine I liked from version 2: powerful, predictable, lightweight.

  The writing and editing done on this book is excellent. The author is very skilled at delivering complex information in a readable and approachable manner.

  This book is a perfect guide to getting started with CFEngine 3, and once you've gone through the example code and the explanations of what is happening, the pieces really start to fit together.

  This book is very well-written, easy to understand, and most importantly - the examples actually work!

  ... this book looks great. It explains the terminology of CFEngine very well. I've used CFEngine 2 for several years, but the change to version 3 had a large learning curve. This book definitely helped to lessen the curve and help me to develop new promises quickly. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to learn CFEngine 3.

I am happy to announce that the new version of "Learning CFEngine" is now available! It's been a long time coming, but it's finally here. Among many other changes, the book has been updated to cover CFEngine 3.12 LTS.

You can get it right now at https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine/, or by clicking on the box to the right.

Some other changes you may notice:

- The name of the book has changed to "Learning CFEngine" instead of "Learning CFEngine 3". At the time of its first publication, CFEngine 3 was relatively new, but by now I feel it is no longer necessary to specify the version.
- The cover is also new! I will write more about it in the future.
- The book is now published via LeanPub, which makes the publishing process extremely easy, so I expect to make new releases much more frequently than before. You can purchase the book now, and get free updates as I release them.

I really hope you like this new release, and would very much welcome your feedback! Feel free to use the [[https://leanpub.com/learning-cfengine/email_author/new][Email the Author]] form or the [[https://community.leanpub.com/c/learning-cfengi][Learning CFEngine Forum]].

I would like to thank everyone in the community for their encouragement, kind words and ideas.
